This is a small speech recognition app based on the JavaScript30 online coding challenge
(javascript30.com) from Wes Bos

The app will write down for you everything you say.

Instructions:
1. You can run the app yourself, but you will need a live server.
   You can
   ```
   npm install
   
   npm start
   ```
   or run the gitpage below:
    https://chrisbourgeonnier.github.io/speech-recognition/
   
2. It is compatible with Chrome and Edge, but not Firefox nor Opera at the moment.

3. Make sure you authorize the use of your microphone, that your microphone isn't muted, that your microphone is plugged... and that you do have a microphone ;)
